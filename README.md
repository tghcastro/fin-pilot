# 🧮 Fin Pilot

**Fin Pilot** is a TypeScript-based project designed to implement financial calculators using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles.  
The first module will focus on a **compound interest calculator**, but the architecture is designed to easily support many other financial tools in the future.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository serves as a learning and experimentation platform for:

- Practicing **TypeScript** and solid **OOP architecture**
- Building **unit tests** and **test automation** with **Jest**
- Exploring **API design** and backend service organization
- Experimenting with **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and other modern development tools

> Fin Pilot aims to evolve into both a service and a web application for testing practices, and experimenting with various technologies.

## 🚧 Project Status

> The project is currently under development.  
> Core architecture, calculator logic, and unit test setup are being implemented.
